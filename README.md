## Setup

**Note**: If you update the package name in the `Project.toml` rename the file in the `src/ProjectStarter.jl` to `src/New-Package-Name.jl` this should prevent any errors when setting up the project. Remember to also import the new package into your tests with `using New-Package-Name` statement at the top.

### 1. Activate Your Project Environment

Make sure youâ€™re in the directory of your project, then launch Julia and activate the project environment:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.activate(".")
```

This tells Julia to use the `Project.toml` and (if it exists) the `Manifest.toml` in the current directory.

### 2. Install the Packages

The `Pkg.instantiate()` command reads the `Project.toml` (and, if available, the `Manifest.toml`) file and installs all the necessary dependencies for the project into your local environment. 

```julia
Pkg.instantiate()
```

### 3. To Install Packages

You can add packages by using the `Pkg.add` function. Make sure to separate the package names with commas in the array. For example:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add([
    "LinearAlgebra"
])
```

This command will update your `Project.toml` file by adding the packages to the `[deps]` section and generate or update the `Manifest.toml` file with the resolved dependencies.

### 4. Running the Unit Tests

To run your tests, follow these steps:

1. **Activate the Environment:**  
   In the Julia REPL, navigate to your project directory and activate its environment:
   ```julia
   using Pkg
   Pkg.activate(".")
   ```

2. **Run the Tests:**  
   After activation, execute:
   ```julia
   Pkg.test()
   ```
   This command will run the tests defined in `test/runtests.jl`.

Alternatively, you can run the tests from the command line with:
```bash
julia --project=. -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.test()'
```
